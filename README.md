## 🏗️ Core Domains of AI

### 1. **Machine Learning (ML)**
   - Algorithms that improve through experience
   - Subfields:
     - **Supervised Learning**: Predict from labeled data
     - **Unsupervised Learning**: Discover patterns in unlabeled data
     - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn by interacting with an environment

### 2. **Deep Learning (DL)**
   - A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers
   - Applications: Computer vision, natural language processing, generative models

### 3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - Enables machines to understand, generate, and interact using human language
   - Key tech: Transformers, LLMs, embeddings

### 4. **Computer Vision (CV)**
   - Systems that interpret visual data
   - Tasks: Object detection, image classification, facial recognition

### 5. **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**
   - Physical agents capable of intelligent behavior
   - Integration of perception, planning, and actuation
